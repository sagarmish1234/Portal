# Spring-Boot React Project

_Example project to start building your own web application_

## Starting 🚀

These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements 📋

Software and tools you will need to run this project:
* Java 11 (_tested version_)
* Node v14.17.3 (_tested version_)
* yarn 1.22.10 (_tested version_)
* Eclipse
* VS Code (_Reccomended for frontend developement_)

### Local deployment 🔧

There are two ways to work in your local environment:

1. Spring-Boot app in port 8080 and React app in port 3000 (_Recommended for development_)
2. Both apps running in port 8080

Let's see how to work with each option.

_Note: both frontend and backend are configured to start on path /projectname. Moreover frontend subpaths follow this pattern: /projectname/#/subpath (due to deployment requirements it is necessary to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter)_

**1. Access frontend in port 3030 (_Reccomended for development_)**

* Install your maven project
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
* Start backend sever
    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
* Install your frontend app (not necessary if mvn install was executed correctly)
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
* Start react app
    ```
    yarn start
    ```

Now you can test your app in http://localhost:3000/jpmcportal

**2. Access frontend in port 8080**

* Install your maven project
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
* Start the application
    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
Thanks to the provided plugin configuration you can access your React app directly on http://localhost:8080/jpmcportal

## Deployment 📦
Production deploy will be made via Jenkins to Kubernetes.

Steps to follow:
1. Build the project
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
2. Create docker image
    ```
    mvn k8s:build
    ```
3. Undeploy Kubernetes app (_only needed if app is already deployed_)
    ```
    mvn k8s:undeploy
    ```
4. Push image to GitLab registry
    ```
    mvn k8s:push
    ```
5. Deploy pushed image to Kubernetes
    ```
    # Generate deploy files
    mvn k8s:resource
    # Deploy to Kubernetes
    mvn k8s:deploy
    ```
